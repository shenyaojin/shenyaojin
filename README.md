**Current Project**

- Bakken Mariner, Williston Basin, North Dakota. Sponsored by ExxonMobil.
- fibeRIS development, a tool designed to analyze time-discrete data and LF-DAS data simulation.
- Hydraulic fracture monitoring using DFOS. In this project, hydraulic fracturing fractures are stimulated by electrodes energized with over 10,000V. It's a DOE project.
