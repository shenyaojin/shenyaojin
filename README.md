- 💬 Must say I'm still a freshman in coding. I sincerely hope those geophysical prgrams could bring you ideas.
- 👊 Anime lover. You could visit [another page](https://zh.moegirl.org.cn/User:Keith.Jin) to know about this. Have you heard of [Makise Kurisu](https://steins-gate.fandom.com/wiki/Kurisu_Makise)? 
- 👼 Not skilled in geology though I will get my bachelor degree of geology. Even couldn't identify the type of rocks. Please don't ask me the type of rock because I will be likely to give you a totally wrong answer.
- 👦 Enjoy physics and geophysics. I'm willing to discuss them with every one. I'm proud that I love them.
