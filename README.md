Geophysics Ph.D. student in Reservoir Characterization Project (RCP). I'm focusing on evaluating the potential of distributed fiber optic sensing (DFOS) in **unconventional reservoir engineering**.

**Current Project**

- Bakken Mariner, Williston Basin, North Dakota. Sponsored by ExxonMobil.

Please consider using fiberIS if you are also processing unstandardized and poor IO-performance geophysical data! And this Python library is open to pull requests!
