**Geophysics Ph.D. student**, specializing in **distributed fiber optic sensing (DFOS)** for unconventional reservoir development.

**Current Projects**:

- **Bakken Mariner**: ExxonMobil-sponsored project focusing on multi-dimensional datesets including DFOS, microseismic and engineering data the Bakken field in the Williston Basin, North Dakota.

- **fibeRIS**: A *data analysis tool* for time-discrete and simulated LF-DAS data.

- Hydraulic Fracture Monitoring: A DOE project utilizing DFOS to monitor fractures stimulated by *high-voltage electrodes* (over 10,000V).
